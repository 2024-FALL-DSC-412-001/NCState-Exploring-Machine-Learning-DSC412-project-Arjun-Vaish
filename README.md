# **DSC412-project**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression and K-means Clustering to analyze and predict housing prices based on various property attributes, such as size, distance from the city center, metro proximity, and number of bedrooms.

The project incorporates:

-Linear Regression: To build a predictive model that estimates housing prices and highlights relationships between key property features and valuation.

-K-means Clustering: To segment properties into distinct categories (e.g., small, medium, and large properties) based on attributes like size and price, providing additional insights into the data structure.

This project is designed for learners who want to explore machine learning techniques like linear regression and clustering using Python.

## **Problem Statement**

Real estate pricing depends on multiple factors, including property size, number of bedrooms, and location proximity (e.g., to city centers or metro stations). Understanding the impact of these factors, grouping properties into meaningful categories, and predicting prices accurately can assist in decision-making for buyers, sellers, and analysts. 

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed. Install the dependencies using:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the notebook**:
    Open the notebook (housing_price_prediction.ipynb) and run all cells sequentially.
